CourseGrab is one of the latest applications by [Cornell AppDev](http://cornellappdev.com), an engineering project team at Cornell University focused on mobile app development. Currently catering to Cornell Universityâ€™s class roster, CourseGrab enhances the student enrollment experience by notifying students of available spots in courses they wish to enroll in. 

## Development

### 1. Installation
We use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) for our dependency manager. This should be installed before continuing.

To access the project, clone the project, and run `pod install` in the project directory.

### 2. Configuration
1. We use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) for our user analytics. You will have to retrieve a `GoogleService-Info.plist` from Firebase and then place it inside the `CourseGrab/Supporting/` directory.

    For AppDev members, this file is also pinned in the `#coursegrab-ios` channel. 

    If you aren't an AppDev member, you can plug in your own `GoogleService-Info.plist` by generating one by following these [instructions](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592?hl=en). You will need to create a project within Firebase to this.

2. To build the project  you need a `Supporting/Keys.plist` file in the project.

```xml
?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>server-host</key>
    <string>INSERT_API_KEY</string>
    <key>google-client-id</key>
    <string>INSERT_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID</string>
    <key>announcements-scheme</key>
    <string>INSERT_SCHEMEs</string>
    <key>announcements-host</key>
    <string>INSERT_HOST</string>
    <key>announcements-common-path</key>
    <string>INSERT_COMMON_PATH</string>
    <key>announcements-path</key>
    <string>INSERT_PATH</string>
</dict>

```
For AppDev members, the `Supporting/Keys.plist` file is pinned in the `#coursegrab-ios` channel. 

Finally, open `CourseGrab.xcworkspace` and enjoy CourseGrab!
